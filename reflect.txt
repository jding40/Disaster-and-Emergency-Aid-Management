This milestone is really a well-designed project, which I think is very helpful for improving my C++ skills, and computational thinking. This milestone build up a simple Disaster and Emergency Aid Management system. I followed the instruction step by step, and finally finished the layout of the system, which contains a series of menu system. and I use one set of menu function(Menu::run()) to run all kinds of menus(like: mainMenu, addingMenu, removeMenu, updateQtyMenu). And I learned how to switch from one module to another module through those functions, which  brings me great joy and fulfillment.
But also, I met with some challenges, one main challenge is about the pointer. I suffered from bugs caused by memory leaks and dangling Pointers for several time, some of which later proved to be caused by the copy assgignment function. Now I am very careful with those rule-of-three functions. The other issue that concerned me the most is still the road-map design. Even with those detailed instructions, it's sometimes still difficult to design the step-by-step procesure to realize the final goal of each module.
However, compared to last semester's milestone for IPC 144, this semester's milestone has been much easier for me to handle, which brings me a lot of comfort.I am now becoming more and more confident about my C++ studies. Thanks again for our OOP professor and the designer of this milestone.
